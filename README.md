Project Name: Password Strength Checker



Description: The Password Strength Checker is a Java-based tool designed to assess the strength of passwords. By analyzing factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness, this tool helps users create robust passwords, enhancing overall cybersecurity and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Key Features:

Length Validation: Ensures passwords are at least 12 characters long.

Complexity Analysis: Checks for a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Uniqueness Check: Verifies the password against common or easily guessable passwords.

Entropy Calculation: Measures the randomness and unpredictability of the password.

Feedback System: Provides real-time feedback categorizing the password as "Weak," "Moderate," "Strong," or "Very Strong."

Technologies Used:

Java

Regular Expressions (using java.util.regex package)

Mathematical Entropy Calculation

How It Works:

Input: User enters a password.

Analysis: The tool evaluates the password based on predefined rules.

Entropy Calculation: Calculates the entropy to gauge randomness.

Output: Provides feedback on password strength.

This project is a valuable addition to any application where password strength validation is crucial, such as user registration forms, login systems, and password management tools.
